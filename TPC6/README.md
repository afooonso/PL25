## Summary  
This repository was created to document the practical assignments for the PL class. Throughout the semester, I will develop various practical assignments (TPCs), applying the concepts and techniques learned in class to build solutions for language processing tasks.

Each TPC is in its own folder, containing the developed source code, necessary auxiliary files, and a `README.md` file that provides a detailed description of the work done.
